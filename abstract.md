# Abstract

It all started with me realizing that while I've been working as a backend
engineer for years I don't know much about the frontend side. If only I wasn't
such a curious nerd, I could maybe have used the last year for something
useful...

At Staffbase we use React. And it feels like the whole world does, too. Driven
by my curiosity, I wanted to learn about this thing and find out what it is all
about. I quickly realized that to really understand it I had to go back to the
basics of web development. This rabbit hole turned out to be deeper than
expected. I have come out on the other end wiser and would like share my
findings with you.

This will be a whirlwind tour of how we got from server-side rendering in the
90s, through client-side rendering in the 2010s, to how SSR is making a comeback
in the last few years - and how it all fits together. I'll talk about React and
its competitors, Next.js and its competitors, HTMX, Alpine.js, Inertia.js, and
others.
